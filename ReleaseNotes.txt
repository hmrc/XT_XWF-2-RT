RELEASE NOTES
=============

Apr 22, 2020
Initial creation of new branch, v02-Alpha. 
Functionality as before, but with new additions. 
If used with versions of XWF between 18.9 and v19.9, compressed MS Office documents that using the docx format will be temporarily exported, unzipped, and the content of document.xml textified
If used with versions of XWF between 18.9 and v19.9, compressed LibreOffice Writer documents that use the odt format will be temporarily exported, unzipped, and the content of content.xml textified
If used with versions of XWF between 20.0+, the X-Tension utilises the new flag of XWF_OpenItem ("0x0400 = extrain plain text on the fly and open textual data (v20.0 and later, useful for certain 
supported file formats)" that allows a text based handle to the file object. As such, that view is exported as the text file, and the textification routine is skipped. 
PWideChar variables switched to UnicodeString types for better memory management

Depends on the use of XWF v18.9 or above, ideally v20.0 or above.
