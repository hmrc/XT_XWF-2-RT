RELEASE NOTES
=============

June 2020 v0.4 Alpha
The previously added check for OutputLocation.txt was not working, in as much as it was not being found and read. It should work now
The Loadfile.tsv and Errorlog.txt were sometimes being prefixed by the name of the output subfolder due to missing trailing deliminator in the path. This should not happen now
The Error Log will now add files whose size was 0 bytes and skipped, and whose type was totally unknown and skipped

June 2020 v0.3 Alpha
The OutputNativeStream was attempting to be freed outside of a loop, meaning if the loop was false, it was trying to free a stream that did not exist. Fixed
The secondary handle to the file object for textification was not always properly freed from the first native handle before a second handle was initiated. Fixed
An ErrorLog.txt file will now be created and saved containing the ID's of the items that had a type that was considered unsuitable to allow the file to be meaningfully exported
If the OutputLocation.txt file is missing, it will automatically assume default output to c:\temp\RelativityOutput. Before it would just crash out. 
 
May 5th 2020
Compound office files are now unzipped to the users default temp area (C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Local\Temp\XWF_2_RT_Temp) instead of C:\Temp to avoid filesystem permission issues. 
If file handle assignment fails for any given item as either native file or text file, an output error detailing the item name or ID is shown in messages window
The UniqueID, as reported exactly in XWF is now reported fully, instead of just the ItemID within the context of the partition. So previously, item with ID "1234" was reported as "1234" but if it is
in partition 1, the casewide UniqueID is "1-1234", and it is that which is now reported instead of "1234". 

Apr 22, 2020
Initial creation of new branch, v02-Alpha. 
Functionality as before, but with new additions. 
If used with versions of XWF between 18.9 and v19.9, compressed MS Office documents that using the docx format will be temporarily exported, unzipped, and the content of document.xml textified
If used with versions of XWF between 18.9 and v19.9, compressed LibreOffice Writer documents that use the odt format will be temporarily exported, unzipped, and the content of content.xml textified
If used with versions of XWF between 20.0+, the X-Tension utilises the new flag of XWF_OpenItem ("0x0400 = extrain plain text on the fly and open textual data (v20.0 and later, useful for certain 
supported file formats)" that allows a text based handle to the file object. As such, that view is exported as the text file, and the textification routine is skipped. 
PWideChar variables switched to UnicodeString types for better memory management

Depends on the use of XWF v18.9 or above, ideally v20.0 or above. 

Nov 27, 2019
Initial release of v01-Alpha. 
Current functionality : Enables users to select one or more files in the Directory Browser of X-Ways Forensics, and upon execution of the X-Tension (DLL), it will 
1) export the selected files to a NATIVE folder in the output location
2) export the selected files as text to a TEXT folder in the output location
3) Create a TSV loadfile containing the original filename and path, the filenames and paths of their exported locations, and include some metadata such as Modified Date, hash value etc. 

Depends on the use of XWF v18.9 or above
